Project Specification: Conway's Game of Life in React

I. Program Overview:
The program is a web-based application of Conway's Game of Life, developed using React. Users can set the initial state of the game and the game board will cover the entire screen. The application will follow Conway's original rules for the Game of Life.

II. Features:

1. Game Grid: A grid that covers the entire screen. Each cell in the grid represents a cell in the Game of Life. Its state can either be live or dead.

2. Initial State Setup: Users can set the initial state of the game by clicking on cells to make them alive or dead.

3. Game Controls: Buttons or controls to start, stop, and reset the game.

4. Step Through: A feature that allows users to step through each generation in the game.

III. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. Class: GameGrid
   - Purpose: Represents the game grid. Handles the rendering of individual cells and manages their state.

2. Class: Cell
   - Purpose: Represents an individual cell on the grid. Can be in two states: live or dead.

3. Function: generateNextGeneration
   - Purpose: Takes the current state of the game grid and generates the next generation based on the rules of the Game of Life.

4. Function: handleClick
   - Purpose: Handles user clicks on cells to set the initial state of the game.

5. Function: handleStart
   - Purpose: Starts the game. The grid begins evolving based on the rules of the Game of Life.

6. Function: handleStop
   - Purpose: Stops the game. The grid stops evolving.

7. Function: handleReset
   - Purpose: Resets the game. The grid is cleared and the user can set a new initial state.

IV. Unclear or Undefined Areas:

1. Grid Size: The size of the grid is not specified. We will assume a default size that fits the screen, but this can be adjusted as needed.

2. Cell Size: The size of individual cells is not specified. We will assume a default size that allows for a reasonable number of cells on the grid, but this can be adjusted as needed.

3. Game Speed: The speed at which the game evolves is not specified. We will assume a default speed that provides a good balance between visibility of changes and game progress, but this can be adjusted as needed.

4. User Interface: The design of the user interface is not specified. We will use a minimalist design focusing on functionality.
