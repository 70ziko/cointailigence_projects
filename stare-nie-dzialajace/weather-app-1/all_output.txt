To keep the application updated, we will need to regularly check for updates to the dependencies, improve the application based on user feedback, and fix any bugs that are found. 

We can use npm's built-in commands to check for updates to the dependencies. The `npm outdated` command will show a list of dependencies that have newer versions available. We can then update these dependencies using the `npm update` command. 

We can also use tools like Dependabot, which can automatically create pull requests to update dependencies in your project.

To improve the application based on user feedback, we should have a system in place for collecting and analyzing user feedback. This could be as simple as a form on the application's website, or it could involve more sophisticated user analytics.

To fix bugs, we should have a system in place for tracking and managing bugs. This could be a bug tracker like Jira, or it could be as simple as GitHub issues.

Here's an example of how you might structure a script to regularly check for updates and improvements:

update.js
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Check for updates to the npm dependencies
exec('npm outdated', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Outdated dependencies:\n${stdout}`);
});

// TODO: Add code to check for user feedback and bugs
```

To run this script, you can use the `node update.js` command.

Please note that this is a simplified example and a real update script would likely be more complex. For example, you might want to automate the process of updating dependencies and testing the application to make sure the updates didn't break anything. You might also want to add code to analyze user feedback and prioritize improvements based on this feedback.

Remember to also keep your application's documentation updated. If you make changes to the application's functionality, make sure to update the comments in the code, the README file, and any other documentation. This will help future developers understand how the application works and how to maintain and update it.
