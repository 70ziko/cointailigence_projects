To keep the application updated, we will need to regularly check for updates to the dependencies, improve the application based on user feedback, and fix any bugs that are found. 

We can use npm's built-in commands to check for updates to the dependencies. The `npm outdated` command will show a list of dependencies that have newer versions available. We can then update these dependencies using the `npm update` command. 

We can also use tools like Dependabot, which can automatically create pull requests to update dependencies in your project.

To improve the application based on user feedback, we should have a system in place for collecting and analyzing user feedback. This could be as simple as a form on the application's website, or it could involve more sophisticated user analytics.

To fix bugs, we should have a system in place for tracking and managing bugs. This could be a bug tracker like Jira, or it could be as simple as GitHub issues.

Here's an example of how you might structure a script to regularly check for updates and improvements:

update.js
