/**
 * The `Dialog` component is used to temporarily display some information in a size-limited window in front of the regular app screen. It is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation. The `Dialog` interrupts the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked. The dialog combines concepts known from other technologies where the windows have names such as dialog box, dialog window, pop-up, pop-up window, alert box, or message box.
 *
 * The `Dialog` is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to the parent window is possible. The content of the `Dialog` is fully customizable.
