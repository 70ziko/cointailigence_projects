/**
 * The `Switch` component is used for changing between binary states.
 * The component can display texts, that will be switched, based on the component state, via the `textOn` and `textOff` properties, but texts longer than 3 letters will be cutted off.
 * However, users are able to customize the width of `Switch` with pure CSS (`<Switch style={{width: "200px"}} />`), and set widths, depending on the texts they would use.
 * Note: the component would not automatically stretch to fit the whole text width.
