Firstly, we need to ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website and npm is included in the installation. You can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

The package.json file is the heart of any Node.js project and is fundamental for understanding the project dependencies. Here is a basic package.json for our snake game:

package.json
```json
{
  "name": "snake-game",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple snake game built with React",
  "main": "src/App.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This file includes the project dependencies and scripts to start, build, test, and eject the project.

To install these dependencies, you can run `npm install` in your terminal. This will create a node_modules folder in your project directory and install the packages listed in package.json.

To start the project, you can run `npm start`. This will start a development server and open the project in your default web browser.

To build the project for production, you can run `npm run build`. This will create a build folder with a production-ready version of your project.

To test the project, you can run `npm test`. This will start the test runner in interactive watch mode.

To eject the project, you can run `npm run eject`. This will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project, giving you full control over the configuration. Note that this is a one-way operation and you can't go back!
