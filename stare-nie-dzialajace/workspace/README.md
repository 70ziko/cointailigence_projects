Specification for Snake Game using React:

1. Program Purpose:
   The program's primary purpose is to develop a simple snake game. The game will allow users to control a snake to eat food appearing randomly on the game area. As the snake eats the food, it will grow longer. The game ends if the snake hits the game area's boundaries or itself.

2. Program Features:

   - Game Area: A square grid where the snake moves around. The size of the game area should be adjustable.
   
   - Snake: The snake will be represented as a line that grows in size as it consumes food. The initial size of the snake should be adjustable.
   
   - Food: Food items will randomly appear in the game area, and the snake can consume them to grow in size.
   
   - Score Display: The game will keep track of the score, which increases as the snake eats the food. The score should be displayed prominently.
   
   - Game Controls: The game will have controls to move the snake up, down, left, and right.
   
   - Game Over: When the game ends, a game over message should appear along with the final score and an option to restart the game.

3. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

   - Class `Game`: This is the main class that will handle the game logic. It will include methods to start the game, end the game, and calculate the score.
   
   - Class `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will include methods to move the snake, increase the snake's size, and check if the snake has hit itself or the game area boundaries.
   
   - Class `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will include methods to generate food randomly in the game area.
   
   - Function `renderGameArea()`: This function will be responsible for rendering the game area on the screen.
   
   - Function `renderSnake()`: This function will be responsible for rendering the snake on the game area.
   
   - Function `renderFood()`: This function will be responsible for rendering the food on the game area.

   - Function `updateScore()`: This function will update the score as the snake eats the food.
   
   - Function `gameOver()`: This function will display the game over message and the final score when the game ends.

4. User Interface:

   - The user interface will be simple and intuitive, with a focus on the game area. The score will be displayed prominently, and the game controls will be easy to understand and use.

5. Deployment:

   - The game will be deployed on a website using React. The website will be responsive and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers.
