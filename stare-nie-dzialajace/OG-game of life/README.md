Project Specification: Web Application with Conway's Game of Life in React and OpenUI5

1. Project Description:
The project is to develop a web application that implements Conway's Game of Life. The application will be developed using React and OpenUI5. The application will allow users to observe the evolution of the Game of Life on a grid, with the ability to pause, resume, reset, and modify the grid.

2. Features:
   - Grid: The application should have a square grid of cells. The size of the grid should be adjustable by the user.
   - Cell States: Each cell on the grid can be in one of two states: Alive or Dead. Alive cells should be filled with a color, while Dead cells should be empty.
   - Evolution: The state of the cells should evolve according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
   - Controls: Users should be able to pause, resume, and reset the game. They should also be able to manually change the state of a cell by clicking on it.
   - Speed Control: Users should be able to control the speed of the evolution.
   - Responsive Design: The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
   - `App`: This is the main React component. It will contain the state of the application and the methods to control it.
   - `Grid`: This is a React component that renders the grid. It takes the current state of the grid as a prop and renders it.
   - `Cell`: This is a React component that represents a cell in the grid. It takes the current state of the cell as a prop and renders it.
   - `Controls`: This is a React component that contains the controls for the game. It takes the current state of the game and the control methods as props.
   - `updateGrid`: This is a method in the `App` component. It calculates the next state of the grid according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life and updates the state.
   - `toggleCell`: This is a method in the `App` component. It changes the state of a cell when it is clicked.
   - `pause`, `resume`, `reset`: These are methods in the `App` component. They control the game.
   - `changeSpeed`: This is a method in the `App` component. It changes the speed of the game.

4. Unclear Areas:
   - Design Preferences: The exact layout and design of the application is not specified. It will be designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.
   - Development Timeline: The timeline for the development of the application is not specified. The timeline will be determined based on the complexity of the project and the availability of resources. 

This specification will serve as the basis for the implementation of the project. The implementation will follow the specification closely to ensure the development of a high-quality application that meets the project requirements.
