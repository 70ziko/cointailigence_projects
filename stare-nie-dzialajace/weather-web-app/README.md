Project Specification for Weather Web Application

1. Program Description:
The program is a web application that provides users with current weather data and forecasts for the next five days. The data is displayed on a map, allowing users to visually understand the weather conditions in different locations. Users can search for specific locations using a search bar.

2. Features:
- Display Current Weather: The application should display the current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny).
- 5-Day Weather Forecast: The application should provide a 5-day forecast including the aforementioned weather conditions for each day.
- Interactive Map: The application should display the weather data on an interactive map. Users should be able to click on different locations on the map to view their weather data.
- Search Bar: Users should be able to search for specific locations to view their current weather and 5-day forecast.

3. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
- `App`: This is the main class that renders the application.
  - `render()`: This method renders the UI components.
- `WeatherMap`: This class displays the interactive map and handles user interactions with the map.
  - `updateWeatherData()`: This method fetches the weather data for the location selected on the map.
- `WeatherData`: This class fetches and stores the weather data from the API.
  - `getCurrentWeather()`: This method fetches the current weather data for a specific location.
  - `getForecast()`: This method fetches the 5-day forecast for a specific location.
- `SearchBar`: This class handles user searches.
  - `handleSearch()`: This method processes the user's search query and updates the map and weather data accordingly.

4. Data Sources:
The program will use a public API such as OpenWeatherMap to fetch the weather data.

5. Target Audience:
The target audience includes anyone interested in checking weather conditions and forecasts.

6. User Interface:
The user interface will be intuitive and user-friendly, designed for a general audience. It will consist of a search bar at the top, a map in the center, and a panel displaying the current weather and 5-day forecast.

7. Development Timeline:
The project timeline is flexible, allowing for iterative development and testing. The project will start with the development of the core functionalities (fetching and displaying weather data), followed by the implementation of the interactive map and search bar. The final phase will involve testing and refining the user interface.

8. Tools and Libraries:
The application will be developed using React. Other necessary tools and libraries will be determined during the development process.
