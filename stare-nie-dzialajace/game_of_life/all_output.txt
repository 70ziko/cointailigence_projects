Firstly, let's create a `package.json` file in the root directory of the project to manage the dependencies of our Node.js application.

package.json
```json
{
  "name": "game-of-life",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A web application for Conway's Game of Life",
  "main": "src/app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  }
}
```

In this file, we define the basic information about our project and the scripts we can run. We also specify the dependencies and devDependencies of our project.

Next, let's create a `README.md` file in the root directory of the project to provide instructions on how to set up and run the project.

README.md
```markdown
# Game of Life

This is a web application for Conway's Game of Life implemented with React and Node.js.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/user/game-of-life.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd game-of-life
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Run

To run the application, use the following command:
```
npm start
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
```

In this file, we provide the necessary instructions to clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install the dependencies, and run the application.

Finally, let's ensure all parts of the architecture are present in the project. The project should contain the following files and directories:

- `package.json`: This file contains the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the application.
  - `app.js`: This file is the entry point of the application.
  - `cell.js`: This file contains the Cell class.
  - `grid.js`: This file contains the Grid class.
  - `GameGrid.js`: This file contains the GameGrid component.
  - `GameControls.js`: This file contains the GameControls component.
- `node_modules`: This directory will be created when you run `npm install` and will contain the installed dependencies.
- `.git`: This directory contains the Git repository metadata.

If all these files and directories are present, then the project setup is complete.
