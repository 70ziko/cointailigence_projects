To document the code and usage of the application, we will create a `README.md` file in the root of our project directory. This file will provide an overview of the application, instructions on how to install and run the application, and a description of the application's structure and main components.

Here is the content of the `README.md` file:

# Weather Web App

This is a weather web application built with React and OpenUI5. It allows users to search for a location and view the current weather and a seven-day forecast for that location.

## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-web-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd weather-web-app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the `npm start` command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. You can also view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

To run the tests, use the `npm test` command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all the tests and display the results in the console.

## Structure

The application is structured as follows:

- `public/index.html`: This is the main HTML file that includes the OpenUI5 library and loads our React application as a UI5 component.
- `public/index.css`: This is the main CSS file that includes the styles for our application.
- `src/App.js`: This is the main React component that renders the `LocationSearch`, `CurrentWeather`, and `SevenDayForecast` components.
- `src/components/LocationSearch.js`: This is the React component that allows users to search for a location.
- `src/components/CurrentWeather.js`: This is the React component that displays the current weather for a location.
- `src/components/SevenDayForecast.js`: This is the React component that displays a seven-day forecast for a location.
- `src/*.test.js`: These are the test files for our React components.
