To implement the index file, we will need to import the necessary libraries and components. These include `React`, `ReactDOM`, `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`, `ThemeProvider` from `@ui5/webcomponents-react`, and the `App` component that we have implemented earlier.

After importing the necessary modules, we will get the root element where our React app will be attached using `document.getElementById("app")`. 

Then we will create a root using `ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)` which is a part of the new concurrent mode in React. Concurrent Mode is a set of new features that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the userâ€™s device capabilities and network speed.

Finally, we will render our `App` component inside `BrowserRouter` and `ThemeProvider` using `root.render()`. `BrowserRouter` is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. `ThemeProvider` is a component that provides theme context to the rest of the app. 

Here is how the index.js file will look like:

my-app/src/index.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('app');

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>
);
```
In this file, we create a root and render the `App` component, which is wrapped inside a `Router` component. The `Router` component is used to handle routing in our app. 

Please note that the id 'app' in `document.getElementById('app')` should match the id of the root div in your HTML file. For example, in your index.html file, you should have a div with id 'app' like this:

my-app/public/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this file, we have a div with id 'app', which is where our React app will be attached. We also include a script tag to load our index.js file.
