The package.json file already seems to be set up correctly based on the project specifications. The metadata is defined, dependencies are listed, and scripts are defined.

However, I noticed that we might need a few more dependencies for user authentication and data management. We will use "firebase" for user authentication and database management, and "react-router-dom" for navigation.

Below is the updated package.json file.

RecipeApp/package.json
```json
{
  "name": "recipe-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A React app for creating and sharing recipes",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "crypto-js": "^4.0.0",
    "firebase": "^8.10.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "keywords": ["react", "recipes"],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
The "firebase" dependency will allow us to handle user authentication and store the recipes in a NoSQL database. The "react-router-dom" will allow us to handle navigation between different components/pages in our React app.
