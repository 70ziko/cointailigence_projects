Let's start by creating the package manager dependency file. For Python, we typically use pip and the requirements.txt file. For JavaScript, we use npm and the package.json file.

requirements.txt
```txt
Django==3.1.7
djangorestframework==3.12.2
django-cors-headers==3.7.0
```

package.json
```json
{
  "name": "recipe-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A web app for creating and sharing recipes",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0"
  }
}
```

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/recipe-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd recipe-app
```

3. Install the Python dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the JavaScript dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

5. Navigate to the DjangoApp directory and run the Django migrations.
```bash
cd DjangoApp
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Start the Django server.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. In a new terminal, navigate to the Frontend directory and start the React app.
```bash
cd Frontend
npm start
```

For cleaning up the project and moving files, it depends on the specific files and directories that need to be moved or deleted. However, here are some general commands:

To move a file:
```bash
mv <source_file_path> <destination_file_path>
```

To delete a file:
```bash
rm <file_path>
```

To delete a directory and its contents:
```bash
rm -r <directory_path>
```
