As a developer, I can't fix any bugs or issues without knowing what they are. Bug fixing involves identifying the problem, understanding why it's happening, and then making the necessary changes to the code to fix the issue.

The instructions you provided don't specify any bugs or issues that were discovered during testing. I need more information about what problems were found, what the expected behavior is, and what the actual behavior is. Please provide more details or examples of the bugs or issues that need to be fixed.
