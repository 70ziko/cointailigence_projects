## Project Specification for AI Tool Landing Page

### Objective:
The objective of the project is to develop a landing page for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that can be used to build projects based on the current project structure and user input. The project will be developed using the Python Flask framework.

### Features:
1. **User Authentication:** The landing page should have a user authentication feature where users can register and login to use the AI tool.
2. **Input Form:** The landing page should include an input form where users can provide their project requirements and preferences.
3. **AI Tool Integration:** The landing page should be integrated with the AI tool that will generate the project structure based on user input.
4. **Project Structure Display:** The landing page should display the generated project structure to the user.
5. **Download Option:** Users should be able to download the generated project structure.
6. **User Profile:** Users should be able to view and edit their profile information.

### Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. **User Class (User.py):** This class will handle user-related data and operations. It will have methods like register(), login(), and edit_profile().
2. **Project Class (Project.py):** This class will handle project-related data and operations. It will have methods like create_project(), display_structure(), and download_project().
3. **AI_Tool Class (AI_Tool.py):** This class will handle the integration of the AI tool. It will have methods like generate_structure().
4. **app.py:** This is the main driver file that will run the Flask server and render the templates.
5. **Templates (templates/):** This directory will contain all the HTML templates for the landing page, user registration and login, input form, and project structure display.
6. **Static (static/):** This directory will hold static files like CSS for styling and JavaScript for any client-side functionality.
